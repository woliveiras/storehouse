# GCloud Operation

Operate Google Cloud with explicit project, account, and permission context.

## Process

1. Identify the target project, region/zone, account, and service account
   impersonation requirements.
2. Inspect the current command or script for implicit `gcloud` config.
3. Prefer read-only commands first, using `--format` for machine-readable
   output when needed.
4. For mutating commands, state the exact resource, project, and consequence.
5. Prefer service account impersonation over downloaded service account keys.
6. Mutate a verified local, disposable, or test project autonomously only when
   rollback or recreation exists. Record the evidence that identifies the
   target before running the command; do not rely on a tool-specific marker.
   Treat an ambiguous project as protected.
   Production delete, deploy, IAM, billing, service enable/disable, and policy
   changes require explicit user authorization.
7. Record the final command, output summary, and verification step.

## Rules

- Do not rely on the developer's active `gcloud` project in scripts.
- Do not commit service account keys, ADC files, access tokens, or kubeconfigs.
- Do not add `--quiet` unless the script already makes destructive choices
  explicit.
- Distinguish gcloud CLI auth from Application Default Credentials.
- Prefer least-privilege service accounts for automation.
- Never use a production project as a test target.

## Output

- Target project/account/region summary
- Safe command sequence
- Environment and authority evidence for mutations
- Verification command or observed result
