# 2D Game Art Studio

Create cohesive 2D game art as runtime assets, not isolated illustrations.
Combine available image-generation tooling with deterministic local processing
and in-engine validation. The skill remains useful for direction, integration,
and audit when no image-generation tool is available.

## Operating boundaries

- Work only in 2D. Treat isometric art as 2D when the runtime consumes sprites or
  tiles; route meshes, rigs, materials, and 3D scenes elsewhere.
- Prefer the project's established art direction over this skill's defaults.
- Default to pixel art only when the project and user provide no style.
- Distinguish concept art from shippable art. Never present a concept sheet,
  poster composition, or arbitrary AI grid as a runtime-ready asset.
- Distinguish map art from level design. Keep collision, traversal, spawn,
  trigger, encounter, and navigation data explicit in the game or level format.
- Create original work. Do not copy protected characters, maps, interfaces, or
  distinctive living-artist styles. Translate references into general visual
  traits.
- Preserve existing assets. Use versioned sibling filenames unless the user
  explicitly requests replacement.

## Choose the work mode

Use one or more modes, but keep the current deliverable explicit:

1. **Direction**: define a visual language, style guide, palette, shape grammar,
   camera, scale, and asset constraints.
2. **Production**: generate or edit canonical assets, variants, animation
   frames, tiles, backgrounds, or interface art.
3. **Integration**: normalize, pack, import, configure, and validate assets in
   the target runtime.
4. **Audit**: inspect an existing asset set for coherence, technical defects,
   missing states, readability, or runtime risk.

## Core workflow

### 1. Inspect the project

Read the nearest agent instructions, art docs, engine configuration, asset
manifests, source art, runtime consumers, and naming conventions. Inspect
representative images with `view_image`. Record:

- engine and renderer;
- camera and projection;
- target viewport and display scale;
- existing art style and palette;
- expected source and shipping formats;
- sprite cell, tile, atlas, pivot, and animation conventions;
- performance, accessibility, and content constraints.

If no project exists, infer only reversible defaults and ask about a choice only
when it materially changes the result.

### 2. Classify the asset job

Classify the request before generating:

- character or enemy;
- animation or spritesheet;
- item, prop, pickup, equipment, or icon;
- effect or environmental animation;
- tileset, modular environment kit, or background;
- map composition or playable level;
- HUD, menu, portrait, badge, or other UI art.

Read only the matching task reference:

- Art direction and coherence: [art-direction.md](references/art-direction.md)
- Characters and enemies:
  [characters-and-enemies.md](references/characters-and-enemies.md)
- Animation and spritesheets:
  [animation-and-spritesheets.md](references/animation-and-spritesheets.md)
- Maps, tilesets, and levels:
  [maps-and-levels.md](references/maps-and-levels.md)
- Items, props, VFX, and UI:
  [items-props-vfx-and-ui.md](references/items-props-vfx-and-ui.md)
- Runtime packaging and QA:
  [runtime-packaging-and-qa.md](references/runtime-packaging-and-qa.md)

When integration or engine-specific QA is in scope, detect the installed engine
version and read exactly one matching reference:

- Phaser: [asset-pipeline.md](references/phaser/asset-pipeline.md)
- Godot Engine: [asset-pipeline.md](references/godot/asset-pipeline.md)

Do not assume Phaser 3 and 4 or different Godot 4 releases expose identical
APIs. Use the project's installed version and its matching official docs as the
source of truth.

### 3. Select the style pack

Read the project's style guide first. Otherwise select a bundled pack:

- Default: [pixel art](references/pixel-art/style-guide.md)
- Optional: [pop art](references/pop-art/style-guide.md)

To add a new style, follow
[style-pack-contract.md](references/style-pack-contract.md) and link it directly
from this section. Do not mix style packs unless the user requests a hybrid.

### 4. Lock the asset contract

Normalize the request into a compact contract. Include only applicable fields:

```text
Runtime job: <how the game uses it>
Engine/version: <for example Phaser 4.x or Godot 4.x>
Asset family: <character/enemy/item/tileset/background/UI/VFX>
View: <side/top-down/front/three-quarter/isometric>
Target size: <logical pixels or runtime dimensions>
Display scale: <for example 1x, 2x, or 4x nearest-neighbor>
Grid/layout: <cell size, frame count, rows, columns, tile size>
Anchor/pivot: <for example bottom-center>
Silhouette and shape language: <readability constraints>
Palette and value range: <existing palette or limit>
Material and texture language: <surface rules>
Animation states: <idle/walk/attack/hurt/etc.>
Background: <opaque, transparent, or removable chroma>
Invariants: <identity, proportions, palette, facing, equipment>
Avoid: <artifacts, unwanted elements, unsafe similarities>
Output: <source, final format, naming, destination>
```

For a family of assets, create one contract for the family and a short delta for
each member. Keep shared invariants identical.

### 5. Produce the smallest useful vertical slice

Create one representative shippable asset before producing a full set:

- one canonical character pose before animation or costume variants;
- one enemy plus its gameplay silhouette test before the full faction;
- one item icon at final display size before the full inventory;
- one terrain transition set before a full tileset;
- one playable room or map segment before a full level;
- one animation cycle before every state.

Obtain user approval when a direction choice is expensive to propagate. Reuse
the approved asset as the anchor for the rest of the family.

### 6. Generate or edit with the available client

In Codex, use the installed `imagegen` skill and its built-in `image_gen` path.
In another client, use an equivalent deliberate image tool when available. If
no such tool exists, work from user-provided assets or complete the direction,
integration, or audit mode without claiming that new art was generated. Do not
ask for an API key or switch to a CLI/API fallback unless the user explicitly
requests or approves that path.

- Use one built-in call per distinct asset or variant.
- Use reference images to preserve style, identity, proportions, materials, and
  palette.
- Treat an existing canonical asset as an edit/reference anchor, not loose
  inspiration.
- For animation, generate a complete ordered strip from one approved anchor
  frame. Avoid independent frame generation unless the user accepts drift.
- For cutouts, follow `imagegen`'s built-in-first chroma-key and local removal
  workflow.
- Ask for no text, watermark, scenery, decorative border, or presentation
  layout unless the runtime asset actually needs it.
- Preserve the asset contract verbatim across iterations. Change one targeted
  variable at a time.

Always inspect generated output with `view_image` before accepting it.

### 7. Post-process deterministically

The bundled scripts are optional helpers for repeatable operations. They
require Pillow, but the skill itself does not: when Python or Pillow is not
already available, use the project's existing image pipeline or perform the
documented inspections manually. Do not install a dependency into the consumer
project merely to satisfy this workflow. In Codex Desktop, the workspace
dependency loader may provide the Python path. With explicit authority for a
task-local tool environment, `uv run` can honor each script's inline metadata.

```bash
GAME_ART_SKILL="/absolute/path/to/game-art-2d"
uv run "$GAME_ART_SKILL/scripts/asset_qa.py" <asset.png>
```

- Inspect technical properties:
  `scripts/asset_qa.py`
- Convert a high-resolution source into constrained logical pixel art:
  `scripts/pixel_art_process.py`
- Slice a regular generated strip into source frames:
  `scripts/slice_spritesheet.py`
- Normalize and pack ordered frames with one shared scale and anchor:
  `scripts/pack_spritesheet.py`
- Render a labeled review sheet:
  `scripts/make_contact_sheet.py`

Use explicit output paths and keep raw, working, and final assets separate.
Never overwrite the only source image.

### 8. Integrate only the selected finals

When integration is in scope:

- copy selected finals into the project's established asset location;
- update manifests, preloaders, atlas metadata, animation definitions, tilemap
  references, or content catalogs at the narrowest boundary;
- preserve nearest-neighbor sampling for pixel art;
- keep gameplay metadata outside raster files;
- remove discarded variants and temporary generation artifacts unless the user
  asks to retain them.

Do not claim integration when only image files were generated.

### 9. Validate at runtime scale

Validate both the art and the asset contract:

- silhouette and focal point read at actual display size;
- palette, lighting, pixel density, outline, and material language match the
  family;
- identity and proportions remain stable across variants and frames;
- alpha edges are clean and no chroma fringe remains;
- cells, pivots, frame order, timing, and loops are correct;
- tiles meet without seams and transitions cover required neighbors;
- interactive objects differ from decoration by shape, value, color, or motion;
- maps preserve traversal and combat readability;
- atlases fit runtime texture and memory budgets;
- the asset is inspected in-engine when the project can run.

Report generated and modified paths, the final asset contract or prompt, local
processing performed, validation evidence, and any manual art judgment still
open.

## Default output conventions

Follow project conventions when present. Otherwise use:

```text
art/
  raw/       # generated or imported sources
  working/   # separated frames and processing intermediates
  final/     # selected source-controlled deliverables
```

Use stable lowercase kebab-case names:

```text
<family>-<subject>-<state>-<direction>-<frame-or-version>.<ext>
```

Examples:

- `robot-caretaker-idle-south-01.png`
- `enemy-scrap-drone-attack-east-sheet.png`
- `item-circuit-core-icon-v2.png`
- `tileset-foundry-floor-32.png`

Keep source and shipping formats explicit. Prefer PNG for alpha sprites and
lossless pixel art; use WebP only after verifying lossless settings and engine
support.
