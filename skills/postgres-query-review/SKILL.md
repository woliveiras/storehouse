# Postgres Query Review

Review PostgreSQL changes through correctness, plan shape, and operational
risk.

## Process

1. Identify the query or migration, expected data volume, critical path, and
   latency or safety target.
2. Check correctness first: joins, filters, null handling, constraints,
   transactions, and isolation assumptions.
3. Inspect indexes used by `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`, uniqueness, and policy
   predicates.
4. Request or read `EXPLAIN` / `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for important queries on
   realistic data.
5. For migrations, review locks, table rewrites, backfills, concurrent index
   creation, and rollback strategy.
6. Check connection pool impact and transaction duration.
7. Propose the smallest change that addresses the measured issue.

## Rules

- Do not add indexes without a query pattern and expected benefit.
- Do not use production `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on dangerous writes.
- Do not hold transactions open across network calls or user interaction.
- Run destructive migrations or large rewrites autonomously only on a verified
  local, disposable, or test database with rollback or recreation. Record the
  evidence that identifies the target before execution; do not rely on a
  tool-specific environment marker. Production execution requires explicit
  user authorization; an ambiguous database is protected.

## Output

- Correctness findings
- Plan/index observations
- Migration/lock risk
- Recommended SQL or migration change
- Verification command or metric
